# Sublime syntax for Gemini files

[gemini]: https://gemini.circumlunar.space/
[bat]:    https://github.com/sharkdp/bat

[Gemini][] is a protocol in between Gopher and HTTP. It comes with its own text format that’s something like Gopher-inspired Markdown-lite.

This is a Sublime Text syntax file for `.gmi`/`.gemini` files. It’s only been tested with [bat][].
